This detailed and exhaustive analysis explores the evolution of employment in Malta over the past 10 years, the changes and how it is likely to develop going forward. The global pandemic, undoubtedly responsible for the single biggest shift in working practices in recent times, was another reason that propelled Malta\u2019s leading recruitment brand to commission such a report.", "The study sheds light on areas surrounding employment over the past decade, with some key findings confirming that the rise of female employment rates was the factor that mostly fuelled the overall growth in employment rates, as a result of two main factors.

The general agreement is that AI and digitalisation will change the world of work with the pandemic accelerating this process. The data confirmed that there will be an increase in new jobs with the vast majority in technology and digitalisation, and the exciting prospect that greater use of technology will result in new service opportunities at better efficiencies and lower costs. Most of the respondents in the Keepmeposted survey also believed that greater use of technology would create new requirements in areas such as technical support, risk management, cybersecurity, data science, software development as well as AI, robotics, and the Internet of Things.

I won\u2019t say it didn\u2019t hurt because it really did, but at least it didn\u2019t take impossibly long \u2013 and you were alive, you were healthy and I was pretty much whole.

The reaction in the camp was obviously hostile, with people shouting out things like \u201care you serious?\u201d and \u201cwhere do you want us to go?\u201d in broken Italian, English and Hausa.", "It was close to getting really ugly right then, but the two just gave up and left after a while.", "Word started to spread around the camp that there would be a meeting next morning to discuss this, but that very evening all hell broke loose.", "They came in like it was a war and we were the enemy. I suppose that\u2019s the way they saw it.", "We heard truck after truck coming up the approach road to the camp, and most of the residents made their way there to see what was happening. Mum and I remained in the camp with two-month-old you, but Tom went and joined the crowd. He later told us that soldiers with batons and shields were pouring out of the trucks and getting into formation, waiting in place until they were all ready. A few of the camp residents tried to talk to them, but were roughly pushed away and ordered to stand back.", "At a certain point a voice on a bullhorn started instructing everyone in Italian and English to disperse and clear the \u2018nature park,\u2019 repeating the message again and again for about 10 minutes.", "Mum and I could hear this and started to panic, quickly packing our few belongings into our rucksacks, with another small bag full of your baby things: two precious packs of wipes, some creams, your spare cloth nappy and a plastic bottle that you hadn\u2019t started using yet.", "Suddenly Tom burst in, frantic, and we threw his rucksack and the baby bag at him. Mum took the other rucksack and I wrapped you up West African style, and strapped you across my back. We ran out of the shack and through the camp away from all the commotion, then up the nearby hill along the edge of the forest.\u00a0", "At the top I stopped to get my breath and we looked back.", "One corner of the camp below us was on fire. I\u2019ve always wondered whether it was purposely lit by the soldiers or whether it started by accident, perhaps a lamp that fell and shattered in the confusion. The flames lit up a line of soldiers advancing through the camp with earth-moving machinery behind them, bulldozing the shacks and lean-tos in their path.\u00a0", "The voice on the bullhorn was still shouting something. The exact words were drowned out by the screaming and by the roar of those giant machines, but the meaning was only too clear to all of us.", "There were other people on the path with us, but no-one we knew well. I wondered about that Maltese family that had already been so traumatised even before that night. We never saw Rami or her family again either (though I have heard from her, more on that later).", "We turned around and started walking.", "I\u2019m not going to dwell too much on the next few months after that. We hit rock bottom.\u00a0", "Every time I thought I just couldn\u2019t take it any more Mum or Tom would pull us through, or the kindness of a stranger would somehow save the day \u2013 an old lady who let us fill our water bottles from her tap, a farmer who let us sleep in his barn for a couple of days; an NGO volunteer who gave us a box full of ready-to-eat Meals when she saw us trying to take care of you, and another who gave me her own shoes when she saw the state of mine.", "We didn\u2019t have much of a plan, but the pull north was strong \u2013 Germany, the Baltic states, Scandinavia, maybe even Canada somehow. There was water there; often far too much of it with the flooding that had become so frequent. But most of us who had experienced the creeping, slow-motion death that is prolonged drought would probably take too much water over too little any day.", "In any event, where we wanted to go soon became irrelevant.\u00a0", "Maybe four months after the camp eviction we were stopped for the night in a layby for trucks along the autostrada leading to Florence, when a Carabinieri van came up and we were instructed to get in. We were cold, exhausted and uncomfortable, and a ride in a nice warm van seemed like a pretty good idea.", "We are not angry enough"]},

It is an appeal whereby I\u2019m stating the obvious. It is a civic duty to pay taxes. Throughout the pandemic, everyone expected government to fork out money to help the business community and save jobs. That was the obvious thing to do and that is what we did. But ultimately, at the end of the day, money does not come for free and neither does it grow on trees.

If the asset comes in the government coffers, that is, you make up for your taxes with that money, the tax due on that property is not paid, but all the tax dues that have been accumulated, interest, penalties and so on have to be paid.", " If there are no agreements in place, that is, if they have no agreements of how they are going to pay up for the taxes, yes. Because otherwise we would allow, in a legal way, unfair competition because someone who is paying his taxes would unfairly compete with someone who is not paying his taxes, because whoever is not paying\u00a0 can lower his unit cost.", " Of course it is.

That needs to be evaluated by the board and then it will decide whether it makes sense to pay a visit to Malta to sort of double-check what has been reported. From then onwards, they can make up their minds whether we should go out or stay for a couple more months.

And it has to happen because with the progress we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re quite confident that in the areas where we failed, and I have to mention that there were two areas, we\u2019re registering quite positive progress.", " Yes. Throughout the past week, we organised a meeting for social partners who represent workers. There were also some organisations who have interest in the social aspects such as Caritas and the Alliance Against Poverty. So, the idea is having an additional mechanism to the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). The purpose would be to have a mechanism which addresses spikes in inflation, and that help is purely focused on those who are really in need: pensioners and people on low income.", " Hopefully something like this would be concluded this year so that it is part of this year\u2019s budget speech.", "It\u2019s not something that stopped but was hit by the pandemic. Malta is the only economy in Europe where, in terms of numbers, the demand for labour did not contract at all throughout the pandemic.", "Not across all sectors. There were some contractions in hospitality. But by and large, as an aggregate, the numbers still kept on increasing month after month.", "What happened actually was that the people who were in the shadow economy were regularised because otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have benefited from the wage supplement. Now, the economy is still growing. We are expecting the economy to keep on growing throughout the coming years as well. And therefore, as a result of that, the demand for labour will continue to increase.", "No. I strongly believe in whatever I say. I will keep saying things I strongly believe in. And I think that frankness is something the electorate appreciates.", " Zero per cent. I\u2019m doing whatever I can do in my capabilities to do the best out of this job. If people, of course, are happy with that, they will vote for me.", "Others perhaps will choose other candidates, and they\u2019re free to do so, but ultimately, so be it. I will do whatever I can do for the job but that\u2019s it.", " I think he was discussing something that is quite endemic to this country.", " It\u2019s a culture change. The culture change this country needs in a good number of areas is quite substantial. You cannot expect that things change overnight from this to that.", " Hopefully, yes.", " Because I think we are committed to do what is right. The energy, the dedication and what we really believe in, social justice, we have provided provided enough evidence throughout the pandemic. True, mistakes were done. People, of course, took note of all this. No one is perfect, but ultimately, at the end of the day, I still strongly believe that the best choice for this country for the coming years, in order to make sure that the economy continues to grow and in order to make sure that social justice continues to prevail, is still labour.", " Enough was said about them. People have read a lot about what has happened throughout the past years, there\u2019s no need for me to outline anything about this. I mean, everyone who has lived in this country knows what has happened. What we really need to do is that we have to look forward and we have to make sure that the challenges that we have ahead of us must be addressed.", "I strongly believe that Labour is the party and government that can address these challenges and make sure that people at the end of the day have the peace of mind that this country will continue to provide a decent standard of living."]},

They need to distance themselves from business,\u201d it said.", "MEA director general Joe Farrugia told a press conference that Malta needs to take stock of the social, economic and moral direction the country is taking and address shortcomings, not least with the \u201cprosecution of persons who have been involved in corrupt practices and murder\u201d.", "On governance, the MEA said reforms were needed to address the situation involving positions of trust, secret government contracts and dishing out direct orders.", "\u201cThere is a need to restore confidence in the judiciary, politicians and our authorities to have a society where people can aspire for success through merit and hard work, rather than through a sense of entitlement and cronyism. How can there be faith in the system which awards a person of trust an annual package of \u20ac163,000, or when millions of euros of government contracts are being awarded through direct orders, without any justification or transparency?\u201d the MEA asked.", "It said this was \u201ceroding people\u2019s fundamental beliefs\u201d and creating \u201ca sense of disillusionment\u201d among the population and foreign investors, in Maltese institutions.", "The MEA insisted on changes that would not allow public sector recruitment six months prior to an election except in critical professions like teaching and care and health professionals and that people holding positions of trust should have full disclosure of their remuneration packages and qualifications and must be periodically audited.", "The MEA said companies were concerned about the misdirection to blame the greylisting on enterprises because of a lack of tax compliance. It said that while it supported efforts to ensure that everyone paid their dues, the country\u2019s greylisting was not the result of tax evasion so addressing this was not a guarantee to get Malta off the list.", "Farrugia said the political parties need to move away from promising everything to everyone without weighing the effect this would have on the country\u2019s financing. The deficit increased considerably in the last two years due to measures taken to cushion the effect of the pandemic but it cannot keep increasing and the public finances need to be brought back in check. \u00a0", "On ODZ developments, the employers proposed that this would require a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.", "On transport, the MEA said there should be a phased multi-modal transport system that incorporates roads, sea and underground metro which provided connectivity to Gozo. Investment was needed in a transport system that places people at the centre rather than cars.", "The MEA expressed concern about the natural and built environment, the impending EU tax harmonisation and the citizenship by investment scheme, which should be dismantled to contribute towards repairing the country\u2019s reputation.", "On education, the employers said reform must address the shortcomings leading to Malta\u2019s early school leaving results, which are currently the highest in the EU. Students are to be channelled and motivated into career-oriented disciplines which match the country\u2019s future economic aspirations, the MEA said.", "It suggested the appointment of an SME commissioner who will be able to liaise with micro businesses and SMEs to better address their difficulties as well as the introduction of more business incubation areas around Malta and Gozo to encourage start-ups. It also proposed changes to the Employment and Industrial Relations Act which has been in force since 2002 as well as a better structure for the industrial tribunal.", "Measures must also be taken to address the changing world of work with the formalisation of teleworking, allowing employees to manage their own time.", "On the proposal of a four-day week, Farrugia said that working for four days and getting paid for five was not sustainable but workers can be allowed to manage their own time. On the soon-to-be-introduced right to disconnect, he said a discussion was needed because flexibility had to go both ways."]},

EVs are less likely to require repairs, and owners save thousands of euros in fuel and garage services due to the high-efficiency electric power train, energy recovery through the regenerative braking and low maintenance required.", "The battery is the heart of the EV and is the vehicle\u2019s residual value. The battery is very pricey to replace, and the range of the EV depends on its capacity and health level. Batteries lose their initial capacitive range every year, and the rate at which this loss occurs depends mainly on the storage conditions, driving style and charging schemes applied to the battery.", "The liveability of the battery can suffer damage when unused for too long especially if left discharged sitting in a garage or, worst, under the scorching sun or in sub-temperature on the street. Charging up the battery to full-cycle every time and frequent recharging of the battery will degrade it more quickly. When practically possible, consider a charging scheme ranging from 20 up to 80 per cent. However, the optimal way for long trips is to charge the battery to 100 per cent and drive until it just about runs out.", "Before purchasing an EV, analyse your driving range and choose the battery capacity accordingly. The good news is that EV batteries generally last more than 10 years under normal driving conditions, and in most cases, one will still be able to drive the car as usual but with only a bit less range. Most electric vehicles use ventilators, coolants and refrigerants to prevent the batteries from overheating. On average, coolant servicing is applied every 80,000km or every five years. However, it is best to refer to the EV owner\u2019s manual to check the frequency of flushing or replenishing of any coolant in the EV system.", "Typically an EV uses a combination of a regenerative and conventional friction braking system. Regenerative braking allows the EV to operate on what is called one-pedal driving. By pressing the accelerator pedal sets the EV to accelerate, while when releasing the pedal, the vehicle will decelerate due to a braking torque similar to the engine brake in a vehicle equipped with a conventional combustion engine. When the EV brakes, the motor switches to generator mode and the vehicle\u2019s kinetic energy is converted back into electrical energy, thereby recharging the battery pack. The hydraulic section of the braking system is not used as frequently as in a gasoline-powered vehicle, but one must still look after the brake pads, and even though pads and discs tend to last much longer, the brake fluid needs to be replaced from time to time. The hydraulic fluid is hygroscopic, which absorbs water moisture from the air.\u00a0", "The amount of energy recovery depends on the different driving styles, and together with the regenerative braking settings, it is difficult to give an exact number when the brake pads are to be replaced. Therefore when driving an EV, the number one game is to make the brake pads last long enough and never need to replace them again. On average, the Brake Fluid is to be flushed every 50,000km or five years, whichever comes first.\u00a0", "Same as in other vehicles, the EV uses the same form of wheels. Regular tyre air pressure checks and wheel balancing and alignment is requisite. The significant weight of the EV combined with the added acceleration due to the instant power and torque delivered by the electrical motor will lead to the tyres needing replacement more often than with a conventional vehicle. Also, tyre rotation is recommended every 10,000KM. A safe way is to purchase replacement tyres specifically designed for EV, which generally contribute less rolling friction, are quieter and are more durable than traditional ones, but still, regular tyre maintenance will remain an essential service to the EV.", "Different EV use different types of electric motors, but the most common is the AC induction motor. Usually, the electric motor\u2019s performance is very efficient, and its life expectancy is anywhere from 15 to over 20 years. However, various factors, including unexpected load changes fluctuations, input power supply, and different environmental factors like humidity and temperature, may influence an electric motor\u2019s performance. A reduced voltage supplied from the battery may lead to overcurrent to maintain torque, damaging the electric motor and/or its speed drive. EV motors will break down quicker than intended if contamination from chemicals or foreign particles like dirt and dust debris are trapped inside it, damaging the ball bearings in ways that lead to high levels of wear and vibration. The cooling system and heat sink of the electric motor and speed-drive shall be serviced on time, since it may be limiting the motor\u2019s ability to regulate the temperature, rendering the motor to be less efficient, which results in overheating and may cause a shortage of the windings due to insulation failure.\u00a0", "The conventional internal combustion engine can have as many as 2,000 moving parts, while the power drivetrain in an EV can function using only 20 parts. The continuous torque generated by the electric motor contributes to many EVs having only a single set of gears to power the wheels.", "Fewer moving parts mean less likelihood of mechanical problems. On the other hand, EVs contain a costly battery, electric motor, and speed drive with complex electrical and electronic components.", "One might be glad to learn that EVs need no oil changes and do not worry about spark plugs or timing belt changes. It is a considerable upside that the friction parts of the EV are much more lived than on vehicles with a combustion engine because most of the braking is done by the drag generated by the energy recovery marking the electric vehicle as very efficient and convenient."]},

The Malta Chamber of SMEs has always championed and promoted these values within its core function as these are values and practices which should be encouraged.", "There are a number of benefits associated with consolidated last mile delivery, some of which are underestimated. Primarily, this concept has a direct impact at reducing traffic congestion, an issue which will persist unless everyone makes changes. In highly dense localities such as Valletta, such issues are further amplified.", "Fuel, maintenance and transportation costs are also kept at a minimum with businesses being able to focus and shift their savings elsewhere.

Moreover, there have been changes to Malta\u2019s demographic profile as well as a shift in where people work and live. New technologies and new transport services have emerged to cater to a change in lifestyle, and it is fair to say that residents of Malta and Gozo have more transport options at their literal and metaphorical fingertips than ever before.", "However, these changes have both created several challenges as well as opportunities for Malta\u2019s transport sector.", "Transport systems are complex and continuously evolving. It is therefore a constant challenge for transport planners to assess, predict, and plan for current and potential changes to the national transport network. In light of this, the Integrated Transport Strategy Directorate (ITSD) shall undertake three projects over the next few months that are integral to long-term transport planning for Malta.", "The first project is the review and update of the National Transport Master Plan (TMP). Development of the TMP was finalised in 2017, and it formulated a holistic implementation plan for investments within the transport sector over the period until 2025. This document was developed in tandem with the National Transport Strategy (NTS), which included a series of policy goals to guide the development of the transport sector until 2050.", "The TMP includes 274 measures that take into consideration air, land, and sea transport. It defines clear project pipelines for studies as well as infrastructural, organisational, and operational changes for the sector until 2025. In addition to this, the TMP defined operational targets for a number of indicators of economic, environmental, and social sustainability.", "The time is now ripe for a mid-term review of the Transport Master Plan. Expected to be completed in 2022, the TMP will be extended to 2030 and will take stock of the status and progress towards implementation of the various measures for air, land, and sea transport. The master plan must also be aligned to wider policy framework, such as the EU\u2019s Cohesion Policy for 2021-2027 as well as its Climate Target Plan for 2030. In addition, the TMP must also take into consideration the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), which sets out specific objectives in meeting Malta\u2019s target for a 19 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2030.", "To meet these policy objectives, the update shall again involve an extensive and robust modelling exercise. Individual measures shall be modelled, appraised, and assessed to produce packages of measures that will best meet both national and EU targets and objectives. To complement this exercise, the update of the National Transport Model is another major project that will occur over the next few months.", "The National Transport Model (NTM) is a macro-level transport model which simulates network conditions across Malta and Gozo in present and future modelling scenarios. The NTM was first developed in 2015 to inform and guide the development of the TMP and national transport strategy in general. It is continuously developed and maintained by Transport Malta, with the last major update occurring in 2019. Every update must take into consideration any changes to the transport network and system occurring in between updates. It is a complex multi-modal model that requires a large amount of data to develop, test, and calibrate its results.", "Intertwined with the development of the NTM, the National Household Travel Survey shall also be conducted. Malta has undertaken a National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) roughly every 10 years since 1989. The survey is distributed to a statistically representative sample of the population of Malta, which consists of almost 7,000 households. The NHTS asks respondents a series of questions about their travel characteristics and habits. Integral to the survey is the filling out of a trip diary, cataloguing a respondent\u2019s trips during a typical weekday.", "The goal of the NHTS is to provide valuable information about the ways in which the transport system is utilised. This includes data such as the relative modal share of each travel mode, which demographic profiles utilise these modes, as well as time, origin, and destination information about each trip. By identifying patterns in survey data, further analysis can be performed to identify the cause of these patterns and develop transport policy, infrastructure, and services accordingly.

In the following years, domestic demand is envisaged to continue leading the expansion in economic activity, reflecting especially a foreseen strong contribution from private consumption.

Simi\u00adlarly, the yield on the longer-dated MGSs also moved sharply higher with a corresponding sharp decline in MGS prices. Few investors may realise the actual extent of the declines in prices in such a short period of time. It is worth highlighting that all MGSs maturing from 2031 onwards dropped in excess of six percentage points since the start of the year, with the main declines happening since early February. For example, the price of the 5.2% MGS 2031 dropped from 141.86 per cent (as at the end of 2021) to 135.33 per cent and the 3% MGS 2040 saw its price decline from 126.61 per cent (also as at the end of 2021) to just over 118 per cent.

Yet again, these are directed at institutional investors and the three bonds have five-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities. Given the significant movements in yields over recent weeks, it will be interesting to gauge the appetite and pricing in the upcoming auction process.", "Following the major developments over recent weeks that led to sharp declines across sovereign bonds, including those in Malta, investors\u2019 attention is now very much set on the upcoming meeting of the ECB on March 10, where a clearer indication of the winding down of the QE programme would be expected as the central bank is expected to update its economic forecasts for the next two years.

The surface of the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink can vary its shade at the driver's prompting.", "The fluid colour changes are made possible by a specially developed body wrap that is tailored precisely to the contours of the all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle from BMW. When stimulated by electrical signals, the electrophoretic technology brings different colour pigments to the surface, causing the body skin to take on the desired colouration.\u00a0", "The innovative E Ink technology opens completely new ways of changing the vehicle's appearance in line with the driver's aesthetic preferences, the environmental conditions or even functional requirements. The technology thus offers unprecedented potential for personalisation in the area of exterior design. The BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink demonstrates this potential to impressive effect.\u00a0", "A variable exterior colour can also contribute to wellness in the interior and to the efficiency of the vehicle. This is done by taking account of the different abilities of light and dark colours when it comes to reflecting sunlight and the associated absorption of thermal energy. A white surface reflects a lot more sunlight than a black one. By implication, heating of the vehicle and passenger compartment as a result of strong sunlight and high outside temperatures can be reduced by changing the exterior to a light colour. In cooler weather, a dark outer skin will help the vehicle to absorb noticeably more warmth from the sun.", "In both cases, selective colour changes can help to cut the amount of cooling and heating required from the vehicle's air conditioning. This reduces the amount of energy the vehicle electrical system needs and with it also the vehicle's fuel or electricity consumption. In an all-electric car, changing the colour in line with the weather can therefore also help to increase the range. In the interior, the technology could, for example, prevent the dashboard from heating up too much.", "E Ink technology itself is extremely energy efficient. Unlike displays or projectors, the electrophoretic technology needs absolutely no energy to keep the chosen colour state constant. Current only flows during the short colour changing phase.", "Electrophoretic colouring is based on a technology developed by E Ink that is most well-known from the displays used in eReaders. The surface coating of the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink contains millions of microcapsules, with a diameter equivalent to the thickness of a human hair. Each of these microcapsules contains negatively charged white pigments and positively charged black pigments. Depending on the chosen setting, stimulation by means of an electrical field causes either the white or the black pigments to collect at the surface of the microcapsule, giving the car body the desired shade.", "Achieving this effect on a vehicle body involves the application of many precisely fitted ePaper segments. Generative design processes are implemented to ensure the segments reflect the characteristic contours of the vehicle and the resulting variations in light and shadow. The generative design algorithms enable the necessary formability and flexibility required to tailor the ePaper exactly to the design lines of the vehicle.", "Laser cutting technologies guarantee high precision in generating each segment. After the segments are applied and the power supply for stimulating the electrical field is connected, the entire body is warmed and sealed to guarantee optimum and uniform colour reproduction during every colour change."]},

When inflation is driven by higher food prices, this tends to create more pressure on those with low income, for whom food may absorb a larger share of spending than the average household in Malta.", "The perceived inflation rate could even be higher than what the official statistics show, since the economic literature suggests that households tend to subjectively assign more importance to items which are bought frequently (such as food).

On the other hand, during the month of strict lockdowns, demand for physical goods increased. At the same time, the shipping industry was disrupted by port lockdowns and the increased demand for goods transported in shipping containers, increasing the costs and reducing the overall reliability of shipping transportation. Consequently, in order to ease these disruptions, companies turned to air cargo transport. Even though air cargo is an expensive alternative to shipping, as the container transport costs skyrocketed, air cargo became a relatively cheaper - as well as quicker and more reliable - option.", "At the same time, the air passenger market suffered a huge blow due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as at some point international travel even came to an almost complete halt in H1 2020. Ever since the industry has been experiencing a slow, gradual recovery, it has been steady but also fluctuating, depending on new waves and resulting lockdowns. Additionally, the recovery was not uniform across regions. While Europe and the Americas recovered the most, Asia Pacific travel demand was still 65 per cent below 2019 levels in December, as Asian countries opted for very strict lockdown measures. Airlines based in regions with large domestic and short-haul international markets recorded faster traffic improvement on the back of more relaxed travel restrictions. Companies relying on long-haul international traffic or based in regions with elevated travel restrictions lost market share in 2021.", "A recent Business Confidence Survey of airline CFOs and Heads of Cargo published by IATA is a very good gauge of what business leaders in the sector expect in the following period. The survey shows that pressure on airline profitability diminished in Q4 2021 and the improvement is expected to continue in the year ahead. A majority of survey participants reported improving passenger and cargo volumes in Q4 2021 which is projected to continue in 2022 as well. However, the airline business leaders were slightly more cautious regarding profitability than a couple of months before, due to the Omicron impact, soaring jet fuel prices, and rising market competition that possibly put pressure on yields.", "While the supportive environment for air cargo will very likely remain in place this year (supply disruptions albeit possibly easing, not yet resolved), it will not continue to have the same positive impact on the air cargo companies\u2019 top line as it had in 2021. On the other hand, as the world is slowly leaving the pandemic behind, the expectation is that the tourist season of 2022 will be stronger than the one in 2021 but will remain below pre-pandemic levels. As more passenger capacity comes to the market, the belly hold of airlines will offer more cargo supply, lowering prices, thus pushing down yields, contributing to the worsening profitability metrics of cargo in 2022. Therefore, optimal positioning in the airline sector will probably need to entail less focus on companies with a larger cargo revenue stream and more focus on companies that generate revenue from air passenger traffic.", "Within the air passenger traffic space, due to the improving pandemic situation both from a medical and from a restriction perspective, we can count on the improvement of international and long-haul travel figures \u2013 the revenue stream that has been the most depressed in the past two years for airlines. Therefore, equity positioning would need to be skewed towards companies with a larger long-haul revenue segment. Even though Omicron still creates uncertainty among airline managers, this will probably not continue to severely impact airline profits in the warmer months as the virus subsides. Additionally, the pandemic is increasingly accepted as an endemic disease and is tackled as such by more and more countries that are also supporting our view of improving air passenger market conditions.", "A counteracting factor that should induce caution however is that lower profitability is expected in the passenger space due to more airlines restarting more flights that can hurt the profitability of these companies as price competition kicks in. Thus, passenger yields and load factors of companies should be decisive factors when selecting individual names."]},

When we think about inflation, though, it is important to distinguish between frictional and cyclical inflation. The distinction between the two types of inflation is critical for central banks in determining the right policy action and for how the global economy is likely to evolve from here.", "Frictional inflation is driven by more temporary issues such as the current supply chain and Covid-related disruptions and which we believe is the main source of the excess inflation which is currently being experienced in the US, the Euro area and the UK. Cyclical inflation, on the other hand, is a different type of inflation which is more permanent and stickier in nature and which is normally experienced when the economy recovers and there is more demand than what the supply can handle. If the majority of the excess inflation being experienced at the moment was to be attributed to cyclical inflation, then central banks would definitely be behind the curve and as such would be expected to engage in significant policy tightening, with the risk of either causing a recession, or having to wait a number of years to gradually bring it down over time.\u00a0", "If we were to have a closer look at the US inflation numbers over the past couple of months, it is evident that there was a spike in the data since the last quarter of last year, from the mid-single digit levels registered in the third quarter of 2021, to the 7.5 per cent reading registered earlier this year. This coincided with the emergence of the Omicron variant and more specifically the resumption of supply disruptions, particularly out of China which continues to adopt a zero-covid tolerance policy. This resulted in the closure of, and suspension of operations, at a number of major ports, with consequent disruptions in the distribution chain. A positive development in this respect was the recent approval by China of Pfizer\u2019s Covid treatment pill which could signal a shift away from a zero-case strategy towards one which gives more importance to protecting economic growth.", "When we examine the components that have driven the latest surge in US headline inflation to its highest level since 1982, it is evident that the largest contribution came from increases in energy prices which is partly to blame for the fear of an escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine. On the contrary, when excluding the volatile items of food and energy, the inflation picture looks much more benign with a slowdown in motor vehicle prices (both for new and used cars) and no acceleration in rents, offset by a surprise rise in airfares. However, the latter component is considered extremely volatile and may reflect the release of restrictive measures imposed on airline travel over the prior months.", "Other data out of the US shows that the percentage of consumption expenditure out of disposable income is now back to pre-pandemic levels, in the region of 90 per cent, meaning that individuals are not expected to significantly alter their spending patterns going forward. Moreover, it is also worth pointing out that even social benefits are now normalizing towards pre-pandemic levels, leaving little room for a spike in consumption. Finally, wage increases are also expected to abate as discouraged workers have started to decrease, signaling an increase in jobseekers which should prove supportive in stabilizing wage inflation.\u00a0", "These observations all seem to confirm that most of the increase in prices experienced lately is frictional in nature and that inflation could subside notably over the course of the year. This could come as a notable relief for the market, with some analysts having already rushed to price-in five to seven rate hikes in the US for this year only.\u00a0"]},

On a more global scale, he points out that 70 per cent of fish consumed worldwide is farmed, despite the frequent ire of fish farming.", "Much in line with other pastoral industries, fish farming has strict parameters, in spite of many preconceptions of cruelty and infamy.", "Although unlike wild fish in principle, there are still many considerations taken to the comfort of the fish grown: water quality, as well as cage size, stocking density and the necessity for organic, densely packed and good-quality fish feed due to their sensitive and slow-to-adapt physiology.", "On the other often-noted practices of agricultural industries, there is no real opportunity for the traditionally criticised force feeding and antibiotic or steroid use during the fish\u2019s relatively long 18-month growth cycle.", "\u201cIt is one of the few animals that is bred in captivity and takes so long to grow,\u201d Aquilina explains.", "Fish farming generally contributes to the marine environment in numerous ways, whether through its impact on the surrounding environment to the industries it interacts with.", "Despite the relatively \u201csmall\u201d impact of fish farming on the environment, Aquilina notes that it does not replace the priority of ensuring a sustainable marine environment in the 21st century. \u201cSpin-offs\u201d in the industry are created, whereby experts in marine ecosystems are hired to carry out status checks on the seabed and measure living organisms \u2013 another opportunity generated by fish farming.", "\u201cWe give a lot of work to a lot of industries in Malta,\u201d Aquilina says.", "This ranges even further to cage manufacturers who securely build the enclosures, ferry and barge vessels under the Maltese registry, guards entrusted with the security of the cages, and extends even further logistically. Even the exportation of fish is securely outsourced to a transport company until it reaches its final destination, further creating traffic in the economy.", "Aquilina notes that the Maltese fish farming industry should be proud of its achievements, especially since, as a country, we have no background in the industry. However, forecasting \u00a0a certain future for the islands is difficult due to \u201cstiff competition\u201d.", "International rivals have low operating costs and abundant land, resources Maltese coasts lack. In spite of this, the industry can grow on paper and continue with its role as yet another asset in the multifaceted Maltese economy."]},

You want to shoot what is known as a \u2018front three-quarter\u2019 or a \u2018rear three-quarter\u2019. The idea is that you can show the front or rear end along with some of the profile, therefore seeing as much of the car as possible.", "You should also turn the steering wheel so the closest front wheel is angled towards the camera, showing off the alloy wheel design.

Essentially, you should find an interesting backdrop, such as pretty countryside or a cool urban setting, and place the car within it.", "You should also make sure you separate the car from the background so that the viewer\u2019s eye isn\u2019t distracted. For example, don\u2019t park directly against a building or a hedge, leave a little distance.", "This trick is essential if you want to take professional photos of cars. It applies mainly to proper cameras but it is possible to find them for mobile phone lenses too.", "All of that glass and metal means cars are big mirrors that reflect everything around them. A polariser can change the angle of the light coming into the lens, which helps to eliminate reflections. It means you get richer paint colours and dark, clearer windows.", "As with all photography, lighting is important \u2013 but it\u2019s perhaps even more important to consider when shooting cars.\u00a0", "Being so reflective, shooting at midday when it\u2019s sunny will mean you get sun spots on the bodywork, ruining your shot. To avoid this, shoot just after sunrise or just before sunset when the light is softer.", "Once you get better, you can start to use the light to get creative. For example, bright light can create harsh shadows, emphasising details within a car. Or you can underexpose your shot to create a moody scene.", "This is another tip that\u2019s easier with a proper camera, but you can play around with phone cameras if they have a \u2018pro\u2019 mode that lets you manually adjust settings.", "We\u2019ll assume you don\u2019t have an external flash here, so your best bet is to head into the city \u2013 or anywhere that has a lot of artificial light. Then, park your car within the scene, place your camera on the tripod, and play around with your settings.", "Keep your ISO at the minimum so there\u2019s no graininess, and then set your aperture quite high to keep everything sharp.

Since the start of the year, the US 10-year treasury yield rose from 1.51 per cent to 1.99 per cent and the German 10-year bund yield rose from -0.18 per cent to 0.24 per cent.", "The US bond market has been the main market to watch given that the debate around the high levels of inflation and expectations on central bank policy is more intense. Moreover, market developments in this region tends to influence market pricing in other advanced economies.", "The expectation that central banks will start raising policy rates has been clear for some time now. Central bankers have communicated incessantly that they are eyeing the progress of the economic recovery, particularly the ability to restore employment, and inflation developments to initiate a gradual normalisation of policy rates and end, or reverse, quantitative easing programmes.", "With this in mind, market participants have been scrutinising economic data releases to assess the probability and extent of such policy actions.", "Throughout 2021, bond markets have been pricing in the expectation of a rate hiking trajectory. However, what really exacerbated the move higher in yields in 2022 has been the upside surprises in inflation data, particularly the January readings which pushed US headline rates to 7.5 per cent and the euro area to 5.1 per cent. Still, these higher readings did not result in higher inflation premia in bond yields per se, but it led to higher expectations of a more aggressive response by central banks.", "As can be seen in the first chart, the US rate market is pricing in a much faster pace of rate hikes compared to consensus economic forecasts. Therefore, recent movements in yields seem to overestimate the central bank policy response at the front-end, compared to what should be reasonably expected in the current economic conditions and inflation expectations.", "Moreover, compared to previous rate hiking cycles, the move higher in bond yields in anticipation of policy rate increases has been the most aggressive one yet. In fact, the movement in yields reached four times the average standard deviation in bond yields.", "What is also notable is that, at the back-end of the rate hiking cycle, the market is pricing in a terminal policy rate of around 1.70 per cent, which is lower than consensus estimates and the Fed\u2019s own long run projection of 2.50 per cent. This differential may either be the market expectation that the Fed will halt rate increases at an earlier point or that the market is yet to price-in a higher terminal rate with the announcement of rate hikes.", "Looking at the second chart we can also observe from the past rate hiking cycles is that 10-year treasury yields generally declined from recent highs several weeks before the rate hike announcements. This is broadly explained by the sequentially higher expectations of an economic slowdown, or recession, induced by higher policy rates.", "Again, the recent sharp movement in yields shows that yields have continued to trail higher much closer to the first expected rate increase at the upcoming Fed meeting on March 15. This is likely the product of the high uncertainty around inflation data as the market awaits an updated assessment and interpretation of these developments by the central bank.", "My advice to bond investors is to hang in there and keep calm. Remain cautious but reacting now can be very costly since the repricing in the market has been excessive. We are most likely past the peak of rate hike expectations and volatility in yields. The volatility in bond prices so far has most likely been the worst you can expect for the rest of the year as we move into the rate hiking cycle by central banks.", "There are options to navigate bond portfolios during a period of normalising monetary policy and rising policy rates. For those maintaining a high cash allocation, and therefore an underweight exposure to bonds in anticipation of rate hikes, they should consider supplementing their bond positions with floating rate notes which allows them to earn an incrementally higher coupon in line with the rise in short-term rates.", "The preference at this stage would be to maintain an overall short duration position, or a short maturity profile on average across the bond portfolio, with the view of incrementally adding back duration and longer-dated positions further down the line.", "Corporate bonds can still offer value at current levels on a selective basis, particularly when considering the recent widening in credit spreads (the difference in yields on corporate bonds and the yields on government bonds).", "Certain sectors in the investment-grade corporate bond markets can offer a relatively more attractive level of yield. High-yield corporate bond markets remain a good source for a pick-up in yield with a much shorter duration as compensation for the step-down in credit quality.", "Despite the expectations of a reduction in monetary stimulus, corporate credit should remain supported by the improving macroeconomic backdrop and the generally positive credit trends on the back of improving operational results by bond issuers."]},

So before concluding a purchase, consumers need to be aware that the law does not give them the right to cancel a sale and claim a refund just because they change their mind or realise that they made a wrong buying decision.", "In such situations, the goodwill of the shop or company from where the item was bought is crucial, because the remedy consumers can obtain will depend on the seller\u2019s voluntary return policies. Fortunately, most retailers are willing to exchange unwanted items or offer a credit note. Some sellers even offer money refunds when items are returned within a certain time-span.", "To benefit from these policies, consumers are responsible to check what return policies apply before concluding a sale. Furthermore, if they are not entirely sure of the item and want the possibility of a cash refund, they need to negotiate this condition with the seller. If an agreement is reached, it is important that consumers are given proof so that the agreement becomes binding.", "It is also important to know the terms and conditions of the seller\u2019s return policies before concluding a sale. These usually contain information such as by when any unwanted items must be returned, what documentation is required upon returning the product, and in what condition the goods should be returned. Consumers who fail to observe these conditions might lose the possibility to return the unwanted goods and claim a remedy from the seller.", "The reason why consumers decide to return the purchased item also determines whether the claim for refund is justified or not. If the goods are faulty, or do not conform with the sales contract, sellers are legally obliged to offer consumers a suitable remedy. Consumer legislation allows sellers to first offer to freely repair or replace the faulty or non-conforming product. However, if these solutions cannot be offered, or cannot be provided without causing a significant inconvenience to the consumer, then the latter would be entitled to claim a part or full refund.", "In such situations, consumers may encounter sellers who tell them that the company\u2019s policy does not provide for cash refunds and can only offer replacements or a credit note. Consumers should know that such a practice is illegal because no company policy can diminish their legal rights. Whenever their legal rights are denied, consumers should promptly seek the assistance of the Office for Consumer Affairs.", "Additional rights apply when consumers choose to buy goods online or through other forms of distance selling. Distance purchases are protected by the Consumer Rights Regulations, which give consumers a 14-day cancellation period. Also known as the cooling-off period, during these 14 days, consumers can change their mind, cancel the sale and claim a full refund of the money paid.", "Consumers may, however, be requested to cover the costs of returning the unwanted products to the seller. Should this be the case, consumers must be clearly informed about these expenses before concluding the sale.", "Some purchases do not qualify for the cooling-off period. These include, among others, goods made to the consumers\u2019 specifications or clearly personalised; goods that are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly; sealed goods that were unsealed by consumers and are not suitable for return due to health or hygiene reasons; the supply of digital content that is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumers\u2019 express consent; and the provision of accommodation, transport of goods, car rental services, catering or services related to leisure activities if the contract provides for a specific date or period of performance.", "When in doubt about their legal rights, consumers are advised to seek the assistance and guidance of the Office for Consumer Affairs by filling in the \u2018Contact us\u2019 form found on the MCCAA website below or by calling 8007 4400.", "WWW.MCCAA.ORG.MT"]},

This perception has slowly been changing over the past few years, but in order to completely overcome the obstacles presented by discernment and myth, it is crucial that the veil surrounding estate agents is lifted.", "Due to the fact that buying and selling property in the past was considerably less complicated and less regulated, the industry remained largely localised and informal.\u00a0", "In stark contrast to this, today\u2019s complex world of global cross-border transactions in real estate sales and property investment has made these everyday actions of the industry very intricate indeed.\u00a0", "Stringent due-diligence laws apply to every single transaction and to exacerbate the situation, the advancement of new technology, digital online marketing and worldwide anti-money laundering legislation have made the selling of property a very specialised profession, warranting the services of an expert: the certified, registered and licensed estate agent.\u00a0", "However, apart from the complexities associated with regulation, the core and key benefits of using a professional estate agent from a reputable company are often overlooked and, when assessing the value that such services hold, it becomes immediately clear that making use of these services is extremely beneficial to both buyers and sellers in the majority of cases. Following are some of the key benefits.", "Estate agents save you time in several ways. If you are a buyer, your brief to the agent will result in them compiling a portfolio of properties that perfectly suit your criteria instead of you trawling the vastness of the internet for properties. Very often, properties you find online have been sold and are off the market. An agent will know this beforehand and these candidates will not form part of what they present to you, saving you a lot of time.\u00a0", "Estate agents will also have access to a database of pre-qualified national and international buyers to whom they can present your property immediately versus a local \u2018shotgun approach\u2019 most sellers will deploy should they prefer to sell their property themselves. Additionally, agents will also filter out curious \u2018bogus buyers\u2019 who merely want to snoop around and have a look at your home.", "Estate agents deal with property for a living. They are immersed in it every second of the day and know the stock, new listings, the history of any given property and even if it is suitable to present to a potential buyer. They know the areas, market conditions, what is trending and which properties to avoid, whereas a buyer that scours the market does not.", "Professional estate agents know the rules and regulations, the laws applicable to each property and every transaction and have all the right connections.\u00a0", "Most of us, as buyers and sellers, have other jobs and do not deal with property transactions for a living, so we might not give it our undivided attention. This is where an estate agent worth their salt will really shine and take all the burdens and stress off your shoulders.", "Estate agents do not only have a pool of qualified local buyers and investors, but also access to countless foreign buyers a seller will not have.\u00a0", "Professional and qualitative real estate companies invest heavily in marketing Malta at foreign fairs, on international portals and creating international agency agreements with third-party firms. This is a very important game-changer in the business of property sales, especially in countries like Malta where there is a strong expat appeal.", "Good estate agents are masters at reading situations and people. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, you will most likely be an open book with your emotions, and this can be detrimental in getting the best deal. Buyers and sellers are very likely to be influenced by their emotions, thus clouding their judgement in making a sound decision.\u00a0", "Estate agents are impartial: they have an obligation towards their reputation, acting in the best interest of both the buyer and seller and are not emotionally invested on a personal level with a property, as they do not own it or intend buying it themselves. They can, therefore, make a far better and clear-headed decision during negotiations and the biggest benefit is that you do not even have to be present.\u00a0", "Agents are also skilled in reading facial cues and body language, whereas the public is generally unaware of any of the signs and signals a potential buyer or seller may display.", "It is not in the best interest of a good agent to overvalue a property, as the property will not sell or at best stay on the market until the expected value of the property is one day reached.\u00a0", "In arriving at the right price for your home, estate agents will carry out a comparative market analysis of your home, as they have access to information and historic records of sales in your area that you will not have, while also comparing your property to similar properties that have just been sold, thus gauging real-time market prices.", "It must also be noted that sellers\u2019 egos usually play a huge role in property:\u00a0typically when an agent realistically values a property at the right price, the seller will either think they can get more or that their home is far better than similar-sized properties recently sold in the area. This may not always be the case, as the agent has based their advice on the cold truth: simply what the market will be willing to pay for your home.\u00a0", "Respectfully so, it is always the prerogative of the seller to establish or agree on the final selling price, but if this is completely unrealistic, agents may not feel comfortable promoting an overpriced property.\u00a0", "On the other hand, all is not lost, as an initial marketing price that exceeds (within bounds) the expected selling price can always be adjusted over time, should the property initially not sell. In this case, you will most likely recall the agent\u2019s primary advice when you went to market.", "When it comes to buyers, a good agent will also advise them when their offer is what is considered cheeky or \u2018low-ball\u2019. Also, while a property consultant is duty-bound to pass on any submitted offers, don\u2019t expect a good agent to be very keen to present this offer as a \u2018best push\u2019 when it is actually considered as an insult.", "Besides normal business hours, estate agents also work after hours, on weekends and public holidays, as this is usually the ideal time when buyers have spare time to look at properties or when sellers can afford to accommodate viewings.\u00a0", "A big part of an estate agent\u2019s day is taken up by scheduling appointments that are convenient for both buyers and sellers and scouting the market to find the right property (which may not yet even be for sale) for their clients.\u00a0", "Many agents go beyond the call of duty and will, for instance, shop on behalf of clients, collect or drop them off at the airport, arrange bookings at restaurants and much more, although this is not expected.", "Agents will set up and organise appointments with notaries, architects and deal with the bureaucracy of state departments, all of which takes a lot of time and effort. Just know that when you are asleep or at the beach, sharing quality time with your family, it\u2019s unlikely that your agent will be doing the same, as they will still be at the office.\u00a0", "It can be said that the days of the \u2018informal\u2019 estate agent or \u2018sensar\u2019 are over. In order to be considered a professional agent, extremely hard work is involved, knowing the law, serving your clients well and sacrificing a large share of your personal home life to stay on top. Those of us who have used estate agents in the past realise all of the benefits: estate agents save you time and money. The fact that they relieve all stress and worry is priceless. This alone is worth every cent of their income."]},

Market expectations on the number of hikes for the year also dropped to five from seven priced in mid-February.\u00a0", "In our view, the future direction \u2013 notwithstanding the uncertainties that lie ahead \u2013 indeed point to two different scenarios.\u00a0", "A first scenario being a further deterioration in bilateral relations, comprising of further attacks on Ukraine and possible destabilization in government, the latter should a Putin-led army continue to get hold of key Ukrainian cities. Inevitably, this proves to be the worst of both scenarios. Europe, the economy most reliant on Russia\u2019s Gas supplies and commodities, may possibly delve into a recession, with economic data taking a turn for the worse. Price pressures, notably headline inflation, may continue to notably head higher, particularly as energy prices continue to surge. Notably, WTI crude futures surged past $110 per barrel of Oil, the highest since 2013, after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that global energy security is under threat amid a worsening scenario in Ukraine and broadening sanctions against commodity powerhouse, Russia, stoked fears of further supply disruptions. Here, a shift towards a more defensive stance, is warranted. Portfolio positioning geared for an improved economic environment and policy hike, requires consideration. It is worth highlighting that a geographical distinction here must be made, with a clear differentiation between US and Europe, the latter, consequent to its ties to Russia, seemingly more vulnerable. Commodities, on track for the biggest weekly rally in more than five decades as the Russian invasion spurs sharp gains for grains, metals and energy prices, shall continue to tighten.", "The second and more benevolent scenario revolves around the de-escalation of such tensions, with cease-fire and peace talks proving successful. While the road to such conclusion, to date seems far afield, the threat of further sanctions on Russia, possibly harsher and inevitably to the detriment of Russia\u2019s economy, may push Putin\u2019s regime to take a step back. Should we witness a full de-escalation, focus will once more turn to inflation and policy decisions central bankers will take.\u00a0"]},

As one can see, the history of the cultural centre is linked to Malta\u2019s two main political parties.", " In my opinion, and I believe one which is shared by others, ", " has witnessed the emergence of many new artists by hosting their first solo exhibitions, thereby introducing them to the art-loving public and sending some of them on successful artistic career paths.", "However, we hosted also the exhibitions of already established artists such as the late sculptor Anton Agius. One must mention also the joint Esprit Barthet/Antoine Camilleri exhibition as being one of highest repute. Agius held five solo exhibitions here. He was an artist who helped us a lot although he was not the only one to do so.", "Another noteworthy example was the exhibition, organised by Ray Zammit, thematically linked to Carmelo Borg Pisani, the artist and controversial personage who was tried and summarily executed for treason during World War II. Zammit had also organised another remarkable exhibition linked to the history of the Maltese ", " (the gallows).", "Away from the visual art scene, the late folksinger (", ") Frans Baldacchino ", " should also be mentioned for his contributions towards the success of the centre through his memorable well-attended performances.", "Actually, the name ", " is a misnomer as our society has become representative of the talent of the whole nation, rather than being limited to the town of Mosta. Indeed, we have also hosted exhibitions by foreign artists hailing from different countries as well.", "I have to mention also the philanthropic aspect of the enterprise \u2013 through various fundraising activities along the years since our inception, we have managed to distribute \u20ac167,000 to charitable institutions such as Puttinu Cares, ", " and others.", "\u00a0", " This is my last year as president of both ", " and ", ", to which I have devoted the last 35 years of my life. I wish to thank my late wife who never hindered me in my endeavours.", "It\u2019s time to pass the buck after 35 years of activity. However, I\u2019m hoping that the fate and success of these enterprises will continue to flourish in the coming years under the management of the very able person who will succeed me. I\u2019ll be helping this person in all ways possible so that everything will continue growing and prospering.", "JB: I thank those persons who donated these tools for our museum of folklore. A family has donated the statue of Our Lady that used to belong to the old Mosta parish church. We\u2019re bound by a contract that ensures the artefact is never to leave the premises.", "There\u2019s a costume that Paul Axiak wore during one of his operatic performances, we have sculptor Anton Agius\u2019s tools of the trade, we have artefacts that used to belong to Hollywood actor Oreste Chircop and others belonging to famous Maltese composer Charles Camilleri. As one can observe, the exhibits are national heritage and not solely pertaining to the legacy of our town.", "Our museum of folklore boasts a collection of very old tools. We are very proud of this, as private individuals are entrusting us with their heirlooms. Schoolchildren benefit from this as school visits are organised and the young ones can admire the implements used in old crafts and, therefore, learn about old traditions and skills.", "We work hand in hand with the school\u2019s council in this respect. Schoolchildren are particularly interested in our annual crib exhibition during the Christmas season.", "Through our annual Christmas and Easter exhibitions, we also cater for those who cherish popular culture.", "It is also edifying that through culture, the society, as an NGO, is aiding those sectors of society who are in dire need of financial help.", " ", "\u2019s schedule for this year includes 18 art exhibitions. However, we had a special programme planned for this special year. It had to be mothballed due to the current pandemic situation. If the situation improves, we will go ahead with it.", " I believe that it can evolve. I have complete faith in the person who is succeeding me as president, and I have absolute faith in the present committee.

He was with us during the flood that killed off our last hopes of saving the olives, and stayed on for a few months after that, trying to help us drain the land and salvage the trees.", "I\u2019m not sure that we had too much in common, but he had the same smiling eyes that you do, and he was always helpful and kind.\u00a0", "I can\u2019t say it was some great romance... we just took to chatting after our evening meals, and I guess we were both quite lonely. Eventually he moved on when it became clear that there wasn\u2019t enough work for him on the farm. Neither of us was too cut up about it.", "If I had known then that I was pregnant I might have told him to stay; or maybe not.

We covered it with some plastic sheeting that I managed to buy at a local store, draped between the \u2018roof\u2019 of the neighbouring lean-to and a rickety framework of wood and sticks that we put together ourselves. It had a horrible habit of falling in on us if the wind blew too hard.", "It was not a good time for us.\u00a0", "Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find work.

This occurred against a backdrop of persistently high global inflation data and changing expectations as to when and how much central banks will increase interest rates in 2022, which negatively impacted financial markets over the first month of the year.", "Global equities, as measured by the MSCI World Index, fell 2.5 per cent in February and were 7.7 per cent lower compared to the start of the year. Value outperformed growth once again, but still fell 1.6 per cent for the month. Declines were heaviest across Europe, with the Euro Stoxx 50 down 6.0 per cent, while the Russian bourse was down over 40 per cent. In the US, the three major indices proved more resilient but were still lower in excess of three per cent for the month.", "The US and European Union were quick to condemn Russia\u2019s actions and impose sanctions against them. Although initially considered a bit light, sanctions have been ramped up to isolate Russia from the rest of the world. Sanctions include banning transactions with the Russian central bank, freezing assets, excluding some major Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system, sanctioning some of Russia\u2019s wealthiest elites, and the introduction of exports controls. Germany have halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, putting at risk the potential of large future foreign earnings for Russia.", "These sanctions are expected to negatively impact the Russian economy and to severely limit its access to $600 billion in foreign reserves. In addition to a falling equity market, the ruble has depreciated significantly, plunging to a record low of less than one US cent, and Russia\u2019s credit rating has been cut to \u201cjunk\u201d status. The Russian central bank has had to increase interest rates from 9.5 per cent to 20 per cent to defend the currency.", "At this stage, the clearest economic impact on the developed world is via food and energy prices. Russia is a significant exporter of commodities, including wheat, aluminium, palladium, gold and corn. Aluminium has reached record prices and the oil price rose to above $100 a barrel. Gold has also moved higher, finishing the month over $1,900 an ounce and recording a 6.2 per cent increase over February. The price of oil increased 11.5 per cent over the month and has risen 43.6 per cent and 66.5 per cent over the last three and 12 months, respectively.", "Although it is early days, and it very difficult to predict geopolitical events, an initial assessment of the likely global economic impact is for a worsening of the economic growth/inflation mix. Forecasts for inflation are being revised higher and economic growth expectations trimmed. The impact will vary around the world with Europe most at risk.", "This assessment is based on conditions that the conflict remains confined to the Ukraine, and the supply of gas from Russia to Europe remains open. The US has no appetite nor public support for sending troops to the Ukraine and engaging in a war with Russia. The situation is similar in the case of NATO. Nevertheless, they will both continue to supply arms and assistance to Ukraine.", "The events in Europe have overshadowed an improvement in global economic data and a drop in Omicron cases globally. Manufacturing survey data improved across Europe in January, driven by a larger than anticipated improvement in the services sector with the negative impacts of the high Omicron cases easing. US consumer spending increased by a larger-than-expected amount in January, reflecting a bounce back from the Omicron impact from previous months.", "Global inflation data remains elevated with the US core annual inflation rising to six per cent, the highest level on record for 40 years. The US Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing the Fed Funds later this month and follow this up with another three or four 0.25 per cent increases over the year. The Bank of England is also expected to continue to hike interest rates in the coming months while the latest events in Europe will likely make the European Central Bank more cautious and refrain from raising rates this year.\u00a0", "Clearly uncertainty is elevated at the moment. In times like this, it makes sense to have more moderately sized relative risk positions in portfolios.

However, while 73 per cent of people surveyed have attended at least one or more arts or cultural events, with the majority of those being the young, I think this survey is an urgent wake-up call of which everyone must take notice.", "COVID has had and will continue to have long-lasting effects on the national psyche of Malta as it has around the world. Reluctance to be in crowds or to be indoors will be a shadow that will stay with us until we are, at last, finally rid of the worst of this pernicious disease.", "However, while this is a factor that cannot be ignored, I strongly believe we now stand at a pivo\u00adtal moment for Malta and for our arts and cultural landscape.

We have a great moment to re-think, to re-set and to revive where we go now as a country and this is a conversation that we must all engage with.", "I am lucky to be closely involved with many organisations in London such as the V&A Museum, the Design Museum and the Serpentine Galleries. These organisations have, over the past few decades, completely changed the way they engage with the public in the types of shows and exhibitions they offer, the way they blend high and low culture, mass entertainment and intellectualism, shows like McQueen, Bowie, Faberg\u00e9, Dior\u2026 these have all entirely changed the artistic environment of the UK and what we consider to be of cultural value.\u00a0", "These organisations sell tickets \u2013 and lots of them \u2013 because they listen to what is happening around the world and then curate shows that respond to that interest. There is no point trying to pursue a road less travelled, as really it leads us nowhere! It is much better to try and create cultural interest within the main highways of life. Some may think this to be populist, but I say there is nothing wrong with being popular.", "In 2023, MICAS will open in Malta. This will be a real moment of opportunity for the arts in our country.

This is a stunning homage to pop culture and again shows how culture can appeal to many different groups of people who perhaps might not \u201cthink\u201d they are into the arts.", "Over in Paris, a major exhibition has just opened \u2013\u00a0", ". Not one, not two, but six of Paris\u2019s major museums are involved: Centre Pompidou, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de Paris, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Mus\u00e9e National Picasso, Paris and Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent, Paris.", "In the past few weeks, we have sadly said goodbye to two of fashion\u2019s biggest names, Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley and Thierry Mugler (whose show we featured in last month\u2019s column) and this most wonderful of celebrations of Yves Saint Laurent allows us a moment to look back at the golden era of 20th century fashion, when life was truly a golden catwalk of decadence and glamour.", "I truly believe the collaborations that stand at the heart of this major undertaking is what really makes this series of shows so special and is something that I think sets the tone of what we can aspire to here in Malta.", "Created by the Foundation Pierre Berg\u00e9 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s fashion house, the show takes visitors on a tour of Paris, offering an insight into the designer\u2019s life-long dialogue with art and literature and his love of the city \u2012 from his roots in the contemporary art of the time to his fascination with gold and decorative arts and his passion for the work of Marcel Proust to his fashion archives and his collaborators.", "Visitors can make up their own itineraries and offers, by its unique direction, new and unexpected perspectives of the work of one of the most celebrated talents of the last century.\u00a0", "The collaboration on show in Paris and the widening of arts and culture into new, emerging and very exciting areas in London all show the arts aren\u2019t something that should sit on the sidelines in our national cultural consciousness; they should be something that talk to as wide a group of people as possible.", "Why shouldn\u2019t computer games, pop music, product design and fashion all be part of the cultural landscape? We must endeavour to reach out to the entire population, rather than wringing our hands in despair.", "Now more than ever we have the opportunity \u2013 a wonderful moment for us \u2013 to create shows and exhibitions that bring our country together, after the past two years, to celebrate, to entertain, to inform, to surprise and ultimately to give us a collective purpose and art can certainly do that. \u00a0"]}
